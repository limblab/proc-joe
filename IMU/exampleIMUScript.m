%% example IMU analysis just to mess around

% read in data (load)
load('exampleIMUData.mat');

% PacketCounter = packet sent, not sure if this is actually equivalent to
% time. I doubt it, but will assume it is for this 
% Acc_# = acceleration in # direction (# = x,y,z)
% roll = rotation about x axis
% pitch = rotation about y-axis
% yaw = rotation about z-axis
